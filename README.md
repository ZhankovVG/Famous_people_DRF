## About the project

This project realizes :
1. The output of categories and famous people (output made differently to demonstrate that I can realize it differently).
2. Made registration in different existing options :
- Authorization and Authentication by session
- Authentication by tokens
- Authorization by JWT tokens
3. Realized pagination on the site ( pagination is possible and I did it for example through settings and in the classes themselves )
